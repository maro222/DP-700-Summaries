## 📘 Microsoft Fabric Data Engineer – Personal Study Notes
### 📝 Context

These notes were created while I was preparing for the Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate exam.
They are my own personal, unprofessional notes that I wrote quickly while studying — mainly to help myself remember concepts, follow explanations from YouTube videos, and summarize what I read in Microsoft Learn.

The notes are not complete, not structured like official documentation, and may contain rough explanations or shortcuts.
I’m sharing them publicly in case they help someone else who is studying the same topics, revising for the exam, or trying to understand Fabric concepts in a simpler way.
The material is based on three sources:

-  `Aleksi Partanen – YouTube tutorials and walkthroughs`

-  `Will – YouTube Fabric/Data engineering content`

-  `Microsoft Learn documentation`
